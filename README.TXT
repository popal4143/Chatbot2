Project Highlights: The program begins by introducing itself and asking if the user has any FMP related questions. The code consists of 35 response phrases (25 Context Based and 10 Random Responses) and if the program cannot understand a statement, it will attempt to transpose the question and ask it back to the user. If it cannot, a random response will prompt the user to try something else. In the future, this chatbot could be combined with a neural net and natural language processing so that it can answer questions more effectively.
